    forward to completing your Mother\u2019s specified request of \u201Cbreaking

    gold found within the den of said beasts. My mother would never want me to damage
    it.

    to help you\u2026Sir Bouldegarde. "

    your stats. *Starts to flex*

    a brave paladin?'

    is not a spell caster. I am a fighter! I engage in only sword-to-sword combat!"

  - Dear Sir, you have not proven to me otherwise. The great Sir Bouldegarde would
    not hide his true self just to protect the world. He would lift himself up and
    allow himself to be free!

  - So tell me, Bouldegarde, what do you need assistance on?
  - In my recent campaign, we are traversing the Great Mount Sno, in order to barter
    with this ancient green dragon to avoid him from attacking the local town.
  - "That doesn\u2019t sound too bad. I am sure your expertise in Taverns and Trolls
    can help avoid any catastrophes."
  - That is my exact issue! I got too greedy and stole a shiny statue before we could
    barter with the green dragon, which has now made him angry at us!
  - "*indicating rise in anxiety, activating comfort mode* Bouldegarde, lets take
    a second, you are doing fine, you are here, let\u2019s play some Snow Run to
    get your mind off it."

  - That calmed me down a bit. Thank you so much, my liege. I just want to know what
    would be the best route to avoid having my friends characters killed?
  - Perhaps your group can barter with the green dragon. Offer it the gold statue
    in exchange for not attacking the city.
  - That does seem rational... I still worry that my friends will despise me for
    ruining the campaign.
  - "Come with me, sir, let\u2019s get your mind off of this with a dance for nobles."
