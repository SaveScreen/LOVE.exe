  - So tell me Bouldegaurde what do you need assistance on?
  - In my recent campaign, we are traversing the Great Mount Sno, in order to barter
    with this ancient green dragon to avoid him from attacking the local town.
  - "That doesn\u2019t sound bad, I am sure your expertise in Taverns and Trolls
    can help avoid any catastrophes."
  - That is my exact issue! I got too greedy and stole a shiny statue before we could
    barter with the green dragon which has now made him angry at us!
  - "*indicating rise in anxiety, activating comfort mode* Bouldegaurde, lets take
    a second, you are doing fine, you are here, let\u2019s play some Snow Run to
    get your mind off it."

  - Perhaps your group can barter with the green dragon. Offer it the gold statue,
    in exchange for not attacking the city.
  - That does seem rational, I still worry that my friends will hate me for ruining
    the campaign.
  - "Come with me sir, let\u2019s get your mind off with a noble dance."
