    creature due to your apparel.

    to help you\u2026Sir Bouldegaurde. "

    danger! I believe you may yet be a beneficial party member, but first I must
    assess your stats\u201D *starts to flex*"

    he has been casting a spell of masks, hiding thines true beauty behind the facade
    of a brave paladin?'
  - "...hey that\u2019s not true\u2026Besides, my dear bot, the brave Bouldegaurde
    is not a spell caster I am a fighter, I engage in only sword-to-sword combat!"
  - 'I believe that you are playing some sort of magic trickery upon me, Sir, I will
    not believe your facade unless proven otherwise. In fact, they should refer to
    thine mighty as Sir Bouldegaurde the Deceiver! '

  - How is that even possible? I guess your stats are quite high, but I still hold
    my reservations about you as you do not trust me
  - Dear Sir, you have not proven to me otherwise, the great Sir Bouldegaurde would
    not hide his true self just to protect the world, he would lift himself up, and
    allow himself to be free

    It is what makes you a well-rounded warrior. You are brave for loving what you
    do, and you need not be afraid of that.
