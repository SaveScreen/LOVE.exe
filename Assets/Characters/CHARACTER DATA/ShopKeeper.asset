  - Hello, fellow bot! I am happy to have you accompany me on this date! It is not
    often I get to ask someone on a date outside of work!
  - Yeah hi. This date better be more entertaining than sitting at home. What are
    you? Like a- a date robot? Do you do anything freaky or do you just listen to
    their problems all day?
  - "I do not know what you mean by \u201CDo anything Freaky\u201D. I am a companion
    for my customers and I help them with their problems!"
  - "Yeah. Sounds \u201CFulfilling\u201D. Do they ever even ask you how YOU are?"
  - 'I am always neutral! I am a bot without emotions! I do not need my own emotions
    to carry out my duties :) '
  - You are such a buzzkill. Do you do? Anything? Outside of working? Like any hobbies?
  - I like to go shopping!-
  - Oh okay-
  - For clothes my customers will enjoy! :)
  - "...Oh. That is\u2026.. Depressing. Okay. Well\u2026 I think you are an embarrassing
    example of what humans think we all are like. I really rather not bother, but
    this is so painful to hear. We gotta get you some hobbies, come with me."

  - I do not know :D was it supposed to be fun? My systems usually tell me if someone
    is having a good time or not so I can feel the same! Because we are both robots,
    I cannot detect what your system feels.
  - "That's the point. You\u2019re not supposed to match how I feel, you\u2019re
    supposed to determine how you feel."
  - I do not understand. Model SK 876, Are you defective?
  - "What??? Don\u2019t EVER say that to me. I am not defective. I will crush your
    little circuit board between my fingers if you ever say that to me again you
    empty tin case."
  - Oh! There was a cold spark in my system when you said that. I will need to perform
    a reboot tonight and ensure my systems are working properly.
  - "That\u2019s called fear you idiot. Have you been confusing your emotions for
    system malfunctions and resetting yourself every time? Okay. Stop rebooting.
    Try this game out and tell me how you feel."

    Can this be\u2026 excitement?"
  - I don't know, probably. Can you stop calling me my model name? I go by Holo.
    H-O-L-O. Got it?
  - "Holo\u2026You\u2026 also keep a secret name? I have one too, it\u2019s *you
    tell her your name*"
  - "Oh? The circuit clown has a secret human name? That\u2019s\u2026 pretty cool.
    Okay. Nice to meet the real you. "

    what you will say to that.

    too. Maybe. Call me sometime when you get tired of this whole gig, maybe we can
    go somewhere new.
