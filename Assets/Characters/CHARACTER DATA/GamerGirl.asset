  - L1N4. When my systems analyze your GLITCH account, I see you are more confident
    online. Why do you have such a different persona?
  - "It's just so much easier to talk to a screen\u2026. I dont know\u2026 IS THAT
    BRAIN RUN??!! OH. EM. GEE.  we gotta go play it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    and people like me for it. If someone leaves me a hate comment, I can just delete
    it and move on. You can\u2019t do that in real life."
  - You were avoiding my question from before. Humans are unpredictable L1N4. You
    cannot control how someone feels, no matter how hard you try! It is important
    to realize you can be liked by being yourself, not being someone you think others
    will like!

    a brave person at all. I feel like a fake online. Like L1N4 is not me at all.
    People don\u2019t want Rosaline. They want to hear L1N4. I feel like it\u2019s
    too late for me."
  - L1N4. We are going to conduct EXPOSURE THERAPY. Grab my hand now. We will see
    how you do on the dance floor!

    I may be a robot but my systems tell me one thing. Rosaline can be just as fun
    as L1N4."
  - "Rosaline can be just as fun as L1N4\u2026 Yeah. Yeah, you\u2019re right. Rosaline
    CAN be just as fun as L1N4. I have a long way to go before I can do those Glitch
    Vlogs outside but\u2026 Maybe I can start small like saying hi when I get my
    spicy ramen delivered? Okay.. I\u2019ll try that. Thank you."
