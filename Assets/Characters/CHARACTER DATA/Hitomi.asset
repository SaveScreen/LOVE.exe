  - "Hello Hitomi Nakamura, It is a pleasure to meet you in person seeing as your
    profile has you as a Technopolis Championship Wrestling\u2019s rookie of the
    previous year!"
  - Oh my! It seems we have a real super fan here! It is a pleasure to have your
    services, I need your help with a very big issue currently plaguing the TCW.
  - My systems tell me that your current run has been plagued by a losing streak
    due to the tag team known as Gloom & Doom. They made you lose your championship
    last Christmas after Fabulous Phlair distracted you in your match with Judgement
    Ripley.
  - "\u2026Correct, see I am not one for cheating but having a partner by my side
    so I can take down those dastardly villains will help me regain my confidence
    and glory. But first I need to test your strength, endurance, and speed"
