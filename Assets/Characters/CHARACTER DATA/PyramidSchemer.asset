  - Excuse me, sir? Barry D. Money?
  - Oh, wonderful! We can begin our meeting.
  - " I apologize, but I wasn\u2019t expecting a \u201Cmeeting\u201D today.  My manufacturer
    programmed me as an interface designed only for dating and companionship."
  - Oh but-
  - Hold on a minute Bot! I actually very much need you for something!
  - "I want you to try a new product that\u2019s been flying off shelves lately and
    conduct a series of tests!"
  - "It's called a \u2018Happy Mask\u2019, and it's said that those who wear their
    Happy Mask all day have shown signs of being much happier than those who don\u2019t."
  - This is very intriguing! I would love to try it out.
  - "That\u2019s good to hear! In fact, I have one on me for you to try."
  - '*Barry handed you the Happy Mask and you put it on your face* '
  - So, how does it feel?
  - ' It is a bit tight. I am not sure if it is suited for me.'
  - "That\u2019s totally normal. You\u2019ll get used to it! Now I would like to
    take you to a park to run my first test. Shall we go?"

  - So how do you feel after that first activity?
  - I do not feel much difference in my system.
  - "O-oh! Interesting. In fact, you\u2019re the first person who has ever said that
    to me about the Happy Mask."
  - ' Really? I apologize, but it may just be because my program is not good at detecting
    changes in signals provided by the Happy Mask.'
  - No, no it's fine, really! Sometimes it takes a little while for the Happy Mask
    to fully go into effect.
  - But no worry! I see we have another thing we could try right at that arcade cabinet
    over there!

  - Seems like the Happy Mask is starting to work now, huh?
  - "Yes\u2026 Though I must ask, what is it that\u2019s used in this mask to cause
    someone\u2019s sudden change in happiness?"
  - "The secret is the mask\u2019s state-of-the-art technology that tracks your mood
    and adjusts various aspects of the mask to increase the user\u2019s overall happiness."
  - Really? So how does it do that?
  - "The science behind it is really quite complex. I wouldn\u2019t want to waste
    your time boring you with all the details."
  - I cannot be bored. I am a robot, but I understand. What is the starting price
    for these masks?
  - The AMAZING starting price is only 5 payments of $99.99!
  - Intriguing! That is quite expensive compared to most face masks. Are you not
    worried about selling any masks at that steep price?
  - For a good reason! The technology that is inside this mask is part of the reason
    it has such a price!
  - We have actual award-winning doctors and psychiatrists including HUNDREDS of
    peer-reviewed articles! Not to mention the thousands of FIVE STAR reviews!
  - I apologize! My systems cannot find a single article, testimonial, or doctor's
    referral regarding the success of your Happy Mask.
  - "R-really? Well, that\u2019s just because we don\u2019t have enough investors
    yet to spread the word."
  - With your help, we could get even more people on board! Let's head to the dance
    floor to scope out our audience!

  date3postgamelines:
  - "Man, that dance floor was just too busy and crowded. I couldn\u2019t get anyone\u2019s
    attention over the loud music and the sounds of people partying."
  - "It\u2019s a shame these people don\u2019t realize they would be having an even
    better time if they had something to enhance their experience such as this Happy
    Mask!"
  - "I apologize, Barry, but my calculations believe your product isn\u2019t going
    to sell well. It might just be too expensive for the average consumer."
  - "I understand, but I have to sell a certain number of units or else my boss won\u2019t
    be too happy\u2026 "
  - Oops! HAHAHA! Forget I said that, please.
  - Your statement has been removed from my memory.
  - "Fortunately, with you, I think we might be able to sell more masks at a faster
    rate. We\u2019ll have twice the manpower. I could even give you a cut of the
    earnings from it."
  - 'Barry, My primary services are to those who want companionship. You must hire
    someone else to help sell your product. '
  - Although I recommend not proceeding with this. My systems are detecting a PYRAMID
    SCHEME SCAM.
  - '*Barry takes off his Happy Mask* '
  - "Man, you\u2019re right\u2026 I guess it only comes out of my pocket if I\u2019m
    hiring you."
  - "Your services aren\u2019t cheap, but thanks for at least helping me out by testing
    my product\u2026. "
  - 'Please come get my services again if you would like to work through your FEAR
    OF REJECTION, Barry! '
